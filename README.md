# sleeqr

sleeqr is a chrome extension to turn the URL you are visiting into a QR code which can be scanned on your smart phone or other device. sleeqr does *not* require an internet connection, does *not* share any information with anyone else(\*) and does *not* require any permissions to install.

As a bonus, it allows QR codes to be easily shared via apps that may be installed on the scanning device: WhatsApp, Telegram, Twitter, email or browser (default).

(\*) obviously, I can't control what happens after the QR code is scanned.

## usage

Shortcut: control+q

Scan QR code to open in browser.

Click 'share' and click a service to open in a different application. Optionally, enter email, phone number or contact name in the textbox to share with a specific person. If left blank, the application will probably ask you with whom you want to share the link.
