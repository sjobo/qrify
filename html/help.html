							<h2>frequently asked questions</h2>
							<ol>
								<li><b>will my smartphone open the mobile version of the website?</b>
								</li>
								depends on the website you are visiting. most modern websites can detect you are accessing it through a smartphone and will automatically adjust the page for that
								
								<li><b>can i change/remove the keyboard shortcut?</b>
								</li>
								sure. navigate to chrome://extensions in the omnibar, scroll down and click keyboard shortcuts
								
								<li><b>can you recommend a qr code scanner?</b>
								</li>
								no. there are hundreds of (free) apps in all marketplaces (android/ios/windows phone/whatever) so just look for the reviews there
								
								<li><b>my qr code reader will only copy text to clipboard / open urls</b>
								</li>try a few different qr code scanners. some have move advanced features than others. if the problem persists, please contact me
								
								<li><b>what about privacy?</b>
								</li>sleeqr does not send any of your data to anyone. the links are converted to qr codes in the browser, not by an online service. however, the qr scanning app on your smart device might send data to the developers of that application which cannot be controlled by sleeqr
								
								<li><b>where can i leave feedback/critique/hate mail/suggestions?</b></li>
								anywhere. if you want me to read it, github is probably best
								
								<li><b>i want to donate/help/develop.</b>
								</li>just get in touch :)
